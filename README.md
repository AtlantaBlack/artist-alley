# Artist Alley

## Description

Artist Alley is a place for artists to share and sell their creative work. Build a portfolio by making posts, set up a store and fill it with merchandise. With everything in the one location, it couldn't be easier — or more convenient — for our artsy folks to do business!

Once an artist has registered for an account they can create posts and add merch to their store for all the world to see. Users can also like a post to give the artist and their work some love!

## Usage

---

No need to clone or download the repo. Simply head on over to the application's page and create an account!

In order to experience Artist Alley, a user must first sign up for an account.

Once an account has been created, the user is brought to the homepage which lists all of the latest posts. Users are able to scroll through and like whatever posts appeal to them. Only one like is allowed per user per post!

Clicking on a post will bring up that post’s details. Clicking on the artist’s name will bring up their showcase. There is a button that can take you to their store, which on Artist Alley is called an Artist’s Table. Here you can see all of the merch an artist has available.

In the dashboard, an artist will be able to see all their current posts as well as make a new post using the form provided. They can swap to their store where they can add new merch. Artists have the option to remove any posts or merch. At the end of the session, a user can log out and be returned to the main screen.
